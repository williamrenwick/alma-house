# baobab-react

Welcome to [baobab](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/baobab)'s [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) integration (from v2.0.0 and onwards).

It aims at implementing a handful of popular React patterns so that you're free to choose the one you want rather than being imposed one by the library.

Currently implemented patterns:

* [Mixins](docs/mixins.md)
* [Higher order components](docs/higher-order.md)
* [ES7 decorators](docs/decorators.md)
* [Wrapper components](docs/wrappers.md)

## Installation

You can install `baobab-react` through npm:

```
npm install baobab-react
```

*Peer dependencies*

This library necessitate that you install `baobab >= 2.0.0` and `react >= 0.13.x` (plus `react-dom >= 0.14.x` if required).

Then require the desired pattern and only this one will be loaded (meaning that your browserify/webpack bundle, for instance, won't load unnecessary files and end up bloated).

*Example*

```js
var mixins = require('baobab-react/mixins');
```

## On root & branches

In order to keep component definitions detached from any particular instance of Baobab, the mixins, higher order components etc. are divided into two:

* The **Root** aims at passing a baobab tree through context so that child component (branches) may use it. Typically, your app's top-level component will probably be a root.
* The **Branches**, bound to cursors, get their data from the tree given by the root.

This is necessary so that isomorphism can remain an enjoyable stroll in the park (your UI would remain a pure function).

## Patterns

### Mixins

[Dedicated documentation](docs/mixins.md)

### Higher Order Components

[Dedicated documentation](docs/higher-order.md)

### Decorators

[Dedicated documentation](docs/decorators.md)

### Wrapper Components

[Dedicated documentation](docs/wrappers.md)

## Common pitfalls

**Controlled input state**

If you need to store a react controlled input's state into a baobab tree, remember you have to commit changes synchronously through the `tree.commit` method or else you'll observe nasty cursor jumps in some cases.

```js
var PropTypes = require('baobab-react/prop-types').PropTypes;

var Input = React.createClass({
  mixins: [mixins.branch],
  cursors: {
    inputValue: ['inputValue']
  },
  contextTypes: {
    tree: PropTypes.baobab
  },
  onChange: function(e) {
    var newValue = e.target.value;

    // If one edits the tree normally, i.e. asynchronously, the cursor will hop
    this.cursor.set(newValue);

    // One has to commit synchronously the update for the input to work correctly
    this.cursor.set(newValue);
    this.context.tree.commit();
  },
  render: function() {
    return <input onChange={this.onChange} value={this.state.inputValue} />;
  }
});
```
